# 🎓 University Course Registration System

## 📋 Overview
This project is a **console-based application** that simulates a **university course registration system**.  
It uses a **Sparse Table** data structure with **Linked Lists** to efficiently manage student-course enrollments, focusing on **dynamic memory allocation** and **fast data retrieval**.  
The project demonstrates key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
1. **Efficient Space Management:**  
   Store only **non-empty enrollments** using linked lists instead of static arrays.
2. **Improved Data Retrieval:**  
   Provide fast queries for student-course relationships.
3. **Dynamic Memory Techniques:**  
   Apply dynamic allocation via linked lists.
4. **Extendable Functionality:**  
   Support **adding/removing students and courses** dynamically.
5. **Stack Integration:**  
   Implement **Undo/Redo** features for enrollment actions using stacks.
